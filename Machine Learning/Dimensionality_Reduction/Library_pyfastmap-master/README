FastMap
-------

FastMap is a fast algorithm for indexing, data-mining, and visualization of traditional and multimedia datasets. It maps objects into points in some k-dimensional space (k is user-defined) such that the dis-similarities are preserved.

Two benefits from this mapping:
    - efficient retrieval
    - visualization and data-mining

The objects can now be plotted as points in 2-d or 3-d space, revealing potential clusters, correlations among attributes and other regularities that data-mining typically looks for.


StringMap
---------

StringMap is a modification of FastMap where the recursion is removed from the canonical `GetPivot()` implementation and the distance is measured in terms of a similarity function that returns a metric distance. It is a linear algorithm to d^2, where d is the dimensionality, or orthogonal directions, of the StringMap. See the reference paper: http://flamingo.ics.uci.edu/pub/dasfaa03.pdf
